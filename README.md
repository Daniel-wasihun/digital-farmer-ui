Digital Farmer App
The Digital Farmer App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to empower farmers with real-time agricultural tips, weather updates, and community interaction. With a modern and intuitive user interface, the app provides a seamless experience for farmers to access vital resources, connect with peers, and manage their profiles effortlessly.
Features

Secure Authentication: 

Users can sign up or sign in using their email.
Email verification via OTP ensures secure access to the app.


Location-Based Services:

On first install, the app requests permission to access the device's location to deliver tailored agricultural tips and accurate weather data relevant to the user's region.
Without location access, the app cannot provide region-specific information.


Profile Management:

Users can update their profile, including their profile picture, via the Settings tab.
A user-friendly interface makes profile customization simple and intuitive.


Community Interaction:

The Chat tab allows users to connect and interact with other registered farmers, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.


Rich Content Access:

Once authenticated, users gain access to a wide range of agricultural content, including tips, tutorials, and best practices for farming.


Modern UI:

The app features a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design built with Flutter, ensuring a consistent experience across Android and iOS devices.
